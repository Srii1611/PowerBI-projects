# HealthCare Analytic Dashboard

## Overview

The **HealthCare Analytic Dashboard** is designed to provide insights into patient demographics, visit patterns, satisfaction levels, and wait times across different departments of a healthcare facility. This interactive dashboard helps healthcare administrators monitor key performance metrics and make data-driven decisions to improve operational efficiency and patient care.

## Problem Statement

Healthcare facilities deal with numerous operational challenges, such as long wait times, inefficient patient referrals, and patient dissatisfaction. This dashboard provides a data-driven solution to:

- Analyze patient flow and appointment types (administrative vs. non-administrative).
- Track patient wait times and satisfaction scores across various departments.
- Visualize trends in patient demographics, including gender, age, and race.
- Identify and address operational inefficiencies through data insights.

## Key Visualizations

1. **Total Patients Visited**: A high-level metric card showing the total number of patients (9,216), with a breakdown of administrative vs. non-administrative appointments.
2. **Patient Satisfaction and Wait Time**: Visualizations that display the average satisfaction score (5.47) and the average wait time (35.26 minutes). 
3. **Patient Referral Breakdown**: A stacked bar chart that shows which departments patients are referred to, highlighting the largest (General Practice) and smallest (Renal) patient populations.
4. **Demographic Breakdown**: Charts that display patient data by **age group**, **gender**, and **race**, providing a demographic snapshot of the patient base.
5. **Visit Patterns**: Trends over time, including:
   - Patients by **Week Type** (weekday vs. weekend).
   - Monthly patient visits.
   - Patient count by year (2019-2020).
6. **Wait Time Heatmap**: A heatmap illustrating the average wait times across different age groups and races, providing actionable insights on how demographic factors may affect patient experience.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Visuals**: Users can explore trends by hovering over visual elements and using filters to analyze specific demographic segments.
- **Demographic Insights**: Breakdowns by gender (51.1% male, 48.7% female) and other key demographics provide a better understanding of the patient base.
- **Referral and Wait Time Analysis**: Comprehensive breakdowns of department referrals and wait times help identify bottlenecks and areas for process improvement.
- **Satisfaction Analysis**: Monitor patient satisfaction scores in relation to wait times and other factors to ensure a high level of care.

## Usage

This dashboard can be used by:
- **Healthcare administrators**: To track patient satisfaction, wait times, and operational performance.
- **Department heads**: To monitor referral patterns and adjust resource allocation based on patient flow.
- **Data analysts**: To generate actionable insights from patient demographics and operational data.
- **Healthcare providers**: To enhance patient care by understanding key trends in satisfaction and wait times.

## Technologies Used

- **Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Data Source**: The dataset contains key information such as patient demographics, visit types, wait times, satisfaction scores, and referral patterns.
  
## How to Run the Project

1. Download the `.pbix` file from the repository.
2. Open the file using **Power BI Desktop**.
3. Load your data or use the existing dataset provided within the project.
4. Interact with the visualizations by applying filters, exploring demographics, and analyzing patient flows.
5. Optionally, publish the dashboard to the Power BI Service for wider sharing and collaboration.

## Conclusion

The HealthCare Analytic Dashboard offers a comprehensive solution for analyzing patient data and identifying operational inefficiencies within healthcare facilities. By leveraging interactive visualizations and demographic insights, healthcare providers can improve patient experience, streamline department operations, and enhance overall performance. This project serves as a valuable tool for data-driven decision-making in the healthcare industry.
